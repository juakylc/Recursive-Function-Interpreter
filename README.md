# Recursive Function Interpreter

Welcome to the Recursive Function Interpreter.
To define a recursive function, you have to follow the next notation:

- Z = null function. 
- S = successor function. 
- (P n j) = the j-th projection of the arity data n (write in parentheses). 
- C = the composition (if you are going to compose g with h1..hn you have to write hi in brackets).
- R = primitive function. 

The vector notation is in brackets and separating the coordinates by commas.
